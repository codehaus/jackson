/**
 * This interface defines the core API that some mappers expose, as
 * well as what they expect helper classes to expose.
 * Only subset of all possible output methods are included, mostly
 * because some simple/primitive types (Strings, numbers) are easy
 * to directly output using a {@link JsonGenerator} instance; and
 * for others because of limitations on overloading (List being
 * an instance of Collection, can not overload). Serializing of
 * any type not directly or indirectly supported can be serialized
 * via call to generic {@link #writeAny} method.
 *<p>
 * Note about <code>defaultSerializer</code> argument: this is meant to allow
 * specialized serializers to only handle immediate container objects,
 * but to dispatch contents to the default handler.
