/**
 * Marker annotation that indicates that the annotated method or field is to be
 * ignored by introspection-based
 * serialization and deserialization functionality. That is, it should
 * not be consider a "getter", "setter" or "creator".
 *<p>
 * In addition, starting with Jackson 1.9, if this is the only annotation
 * associated with a property, it will also cause cause the whole
 * property to be ignored: that is, if setter has this annotation and
 * getter has no annotations, getter is also effectively ignored.
 * It is still possible for different accessors to use different
 * annotations; so if only "getter" is to be ignored, other accessors
 * (setter or field) would need explicit annotation to prevent
 * ignoral (usually {@link JsonProperty}).
 * <p>
 * For example, a "getter" method that would otherwise denote
 * a property (like, say, "getValue" to suggest property "value")
 * to serialize, would be ignored and no such property would
 * be output unless another annotation defines alternative method to use.
 *<p>
 * Before version 1.9, this annotation worked purely on method-by-method (or field-by-field)
 * basis; annotation on one method or field does not imply ignoring other methods
 * or fields. However, with version 1.9 and above, annotations associated
 * with various accessors (getter, setter, field, constructor parameter) of
 * a logical property are combined; meaning that annotations may be effectly
 * combined.
 *<p>
 * Annotation is usually used just a like a marker annotation, that
 * is, without explicitly defining 'value' argument (which defaults
 * to <code>true</code>): but argument can be explicitly defined.
 * This can be done to override an existing JsonIgnore by explictly
 * defining one with 'false' argument.
 *<p>
 * Annotation is similar to {@link javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlTransient}
