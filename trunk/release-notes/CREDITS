Alain Penders:
  * Reported problem with JavaTypeMapper, where floating point numbers were
    accidentally converted to Booleans.
    [0.8]

Mike Eastey:
  * Reported problem with JavaTypeMapper had a bug which prevented custom
    mappers (as well as slower interface-based introspection) from working,
    provided path to specific underlying bugs.
    [0.8.2]

Augusto Callejas
  * Reported problem with JavaTypeMapper (and JsonTypeMapper), which
    caused read operation not to handle EOF appropriately but instead
    cause a NullPointerException.
    [0.9]

Maciej Pestka:
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
    [0.9]
