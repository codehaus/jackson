== History: ==

0.9.3 [05-Sep-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * [JACKSON-5]: Symbol table construction was not thread-safe for
    utf-8 encoded content (new bug with 0.9.2, not present with earlier)
   (reported by Tudor B)
  * [JACKSON-8]: Serialization of BigDecimal broken with JavaTypeMapper
   (reported by Johannes L)
  * [JACKSON-14]: Problems with generic collections, serializer
    method signatures (due to lack of covariance wrt collection types)
  * Implicit conversions for numbers could sometimes lose accuracy,
    if floating-point number was first accessed as int/long, and then
    as a BigDecimal.
  * One Nasty NPE fixed from NameCanonicalizer (which was added in 0.9.2)

  New features:

  * [JACKSON-1]: JsonNode now implements Iterable<JsonNode> so that
    it is possible use Java 5 foreach loop over array/object nodes.
   (suggested by Michael M)
  * [JACKSON-4] Added JsonParser.skipChildren() method.

0.9.2 [24-Apr-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * UTF-16/32 handling was not completely correct, was erroneously
    skipping first 2/4 bytes in some cases (even when no BOM included).
    Also, related unit tests added/fixed.

  Changes:

  * Replace JsonFactory.Encoding enum with JsonEncoding enum
    (NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible API change)

  Improvements:

  * New higher performing UTF-8 scanner.

0.9.1 [14-Mar-2008]:

  New features:

  * JsonGenerator.useDefaultPrettyPrinter()/.setPrettyPrinter()
    allow for pretty printing (indentation).
   (thanks to Ziad M for suggestion, sample code)

0.8.0 - 0.9.0 [between 17-Oct-2007 and 14-Feb-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Java type mapper had a bug in Collection mapping (mismatched
    calls between writeStartArray and writeEndObject!)
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Java type mapper had a bug which prevented custom mappers (as
    well as slower interface-based introspection) from working.
   (reported by Mike E)
  * Numeric value parsing had some problems
  * JavaTypeMapper and JsonTypeMapper had a bug which resulted
    in NullPointerException when stream ends, instead of returning
    null to indicate it.
   (reported by Augusto C)
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
   (suggested by Maciej P)
