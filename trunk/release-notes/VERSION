== History: ==

0.9.2 [24-Apr-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * UTF-16/32 handling was not completely correct, was erroneously
    skipping first 2/4 bytes in some cases (even when no BOM included).
    Also, related unit tests added/fixed.

  Changes:

  * Replace JsonFactory.Encoding enum with JsonEncoding enum
    (NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible API change)

  Improvements:

  * New higher performing UTF-8 scanner.

0.9.1 [14-Mar-2008]:

  New features:

  * JsonGenerator.useDefaultPrettyPrinter()/.setPrettyPrinter()
    allow for pretty printing (indentation).
   (thanks to Ziad M for suggestion, sample code)

0.9.0 [14-Feb-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * JavaTypeMapper and JsonTypeMapper had a bug which resulted
    in NullPointerException when stream ends, instead of returning
    null to indicate it.
   (reported by Augusto C)
  * JavaTypeMapper did not implicitly flush generator after mapping
    objects: it should, and now will (note: JsonTypeMapper not directly
    affected, flushing still needed)
   (suggested by Maciej P)

0.8.2 [03-Feb-2008]:

  Bug fixes:

  * Java type mapper had a bug in Collection mapping (mismatched
    calls between writeStartArray and writeEndObject!)
   (reported by Mike E)

0.8.1 [05-Dec-2007]:

  Features:

  * Experimental version of JSON type mapper
